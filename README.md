<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/iskoldt-X/savebot.svg"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/iskoldt/savebot.svg"/>

## Features

* Supported platforms: `amd64`, `arm64`.
* Save text messages into txt files with message id and the time as label.
* Save Photos and Videos into corresponding folders, and the caption into txt files.
* Nailed files larger than 20MB by using [MTProto API](https://docs.pyrogram.org/topics/mtproto-vs-botapi#advantages-of-the-mtproto-api).


## Requirements

We need at least a telegram Bot and a Python3 environment to run this project.

Don't worry, you can easily get a telegram bot from [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot).

Python3 environment is not a big deal. If you can use Docker, you are basicly a savebot master!


## Run savebot in Docker

If you got your `BOT_TOKEN`, your can use savebot to get your `TARGET_CHAT_ID`:

```
docker run -d \
  --rm \
  --name savebot \
  -e MY_TOKEN=<BOT_TOKEN> \
  iskoldt/savebot:latest
```
Then send anything to your bot, you will get your `TARGET_CHAT_ID`

Run this:
```
docker run -d \
  --name savebot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e MY_TOKEN=<BOT_TOKEN> \
  -e TARGET_CHAT_ID=<TARGET_CHAT_ID> \
  -v <yourdir>:/savebot/messages \
  iskoldt/savebot:latest
```

Telegram bot API is limited on file size, so we need [MTProto API](https://docs.pyrogram.org/topics/mtproto-vs-botapi#advantages-of-the-mtproto-api), get it here [Obtaining api_id](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id)

Now you have `API_ID` and `API_HASH`, congrats!ðŸŽ‰

You can use savebot to save any file!

```
docker run -d \
  --name savebot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e MY_API_ID=<API_ID> \
  -e MY_API_HASH=<API_HASH> \
  -e MY_TOKEN=<BOT_TOKEN> \
  -e TARGET_CHAT_ID=<TARGET_CHAT_ID> \
  -v <yourdir>:/savebot/messages \
  iskoldt/savebot:latest
```


## Run savebot in Python3 environment

Download savebot from github and Get your `TARGET_CHAT_ID`:

```
git clone https://github.com/iskoldt-X/savebot.git
cd savebot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#keep the word empty if you don't have it
export TARGET_CHAT_ID=empty
export MY_TOKEN=<BOT_TOKEN>
export MY_API_ID=empty
export MY_API_HASH=empty

python3 savebot.py
```

Then send anything to your bot, you will get your `TARGET_CHAT_ID`

```
export TARGET_CHAT_ID=<your TARGET_CHAT_ID>
python3 savebot.py
```
